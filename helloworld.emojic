Almost all the code in an Emojicode program will live inside a 🏁 block. 
A block is a collection of code. 
The 🏁 block indicates all the code that should run when the file is executed.

Within our larger program, we can indicate one or more blocks of code with 🍇 🍉 code blocks:
🍇 to indicate the start of the code block
🍉 to indicate the end of the code block

To print in Emojicode, we use the 😀 ❗️ method

🔤 - serves as a double quotation for starting and ending a string
    Ex: 🔤String🔤
