Mutable variables - mutable

Two ways:
  1. declare and assign the variable to a value in one step
    - 5300 ➡️ 🖍🆕 money
    - declaring a mutable variable named money and assigning it a value of 5300
  2. explicitly declare the variable and initialize
    - 🖍🆕 money 🔡
      - 🖍🆕 = declaring
      - money = variable name
      - 🔡 = variable type

  Operator Assignment - a short-hand method for modifying the value of mutable variables.
