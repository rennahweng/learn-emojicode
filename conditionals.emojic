💭🔜
Conditionals:
    - ↪️ checks a condition
    - evaluate condition to 👍 (true) or 👎 (false)
    - follow by a block of code using 🍇 and 🍉 if true

The 🙅 Statement:
    - 🙅 doesn’t accept a condition
    - is added after a ↪️ statement.
    - 🙅's block of code executes if the previous condition(s) are all 👎
    - think of 🙅 as an else statement, its code block runs when all else is 👎
